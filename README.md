# Node-Express-Handlebars

### Overview
I have created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). This application follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route the data and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the top of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
